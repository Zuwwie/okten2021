<h3>Lisa Simpson, This Isn’t Your Life»</h3>
<p class="first">Lisa Marie Simpson[1] is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She is
    the middle
    child and most accomplished of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The
    Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while
    waiting to meet James L. Brooks. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic Life in
    Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the elder Simpson daughter after his younger
    sister Lisa Groening Bartlett. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family were
    moved to their own series on Fox, which debuted on December 17, 1989.</p>
<p>Intelligent, kind and passionate about the planet and all living things, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the
    second child of Homer and Marge, the younger sister of Bart, and the older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect
    and left-wing political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age; therefore she is a bit of a
    loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa's
    character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to
    Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal and activist for peace, equality and the environment, Lisa advocates for a
    variety of political causes (e.g. standing with the Tibetan independence movement) which usually sets her against
    most of the people in Springfield. However, she can also be somewhat intolerant of opinions that differ from her
    own, often refusing to consider alternative perspectives and showing a feeling of self-righteousness. In her free
    time, Lisa enjoys many hobbies such as reading and playing the baritone saxophone, despite her father's annoyance
    regarding the latter. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons
    Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and inspired a line of merchandise.</p>
<p>Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart, while Nancy Cartwright (who was later cast as the voice for
    Bart) tried out for Lisa. Producers considered Smith's voice too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa.
    In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was something of a "female Bart" who mirrored her brother's mischief, but as
    the series progressed she became a liberal voice of reason which has drawn both praise and criticism from fans of
    the show. Because of her unusual pointed hairstyle, many animators consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons
    character to draw.

<h2>Role in The Simpsons</h2>
<p class="first">The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not have physical ages;[2] as such,
    Lisa is always
    depicted as 7–8 years old.[3] The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional
    flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this
    timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.[4] Lisa's year of birth is given in "Lisa's First Word"
    (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during the Summer Olympics.[5] The episode "That '90s Show" (season 19, 2008), however,
    contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the
    late 1990s.[6][7] Lisa is a lover of music, with jazz as her favorite genre; she specifically singles out Miles
    Davis's 1957 album Birth of the Cool as her favorite album.[8] She enjoys and excels at playing the saxophone and
    became friends with jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, whom she regards as an idol. Murphy helps pull Lisa out of
    her depression in "Moaning Lisa" (season 1, 1990).[9] She is later deeply saddened by Murphy's death in "'Round
    Springfield" (season 6, 1995).[10]

    Lisa has had a few brief relationships with boys, including Ralph Wiggum in "I Love Lisa" (the fifteenth episode of
    season 4, 1993),[11] Nelson Muntz in "Lisa's Date with Density" (season 8, 1996)[12] and Colin in The Simpsons Movie
    (2007).[13] Bart's best friend Milhouse Van Houten has a crush on her, but despite dropping unsubtle hints about his
    feelings, he has been unsuccessful in winning her affection.[12] Her voice actor Yeardley Smith said Muntz would
    make a good match for Lisa.[14] In 2019, Simpsons showrunner Al Jean said he saw Lisa as being "possibly
    polyamorous" in the future.[15] In the 2011 Season 23 episode 9 episode Holidays of Future Passed Lisa is shown
    holding hands with an unnamed dark-haired woman in a photo, and then shown in a second photo where she is holding
    hands with two different women at once, suggesting polyamory; she later ends up with Milhouse. However, this episode
    is non-canon.[16][17][18][15]

    Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family (she has an IQ of 159), and many episodes of the series
    focus on her fighting for various causes.[19] Lisa is often the focus of episodes with "a real moral or
    philosophical point", which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because "you really buy her as caring about
    it."[20] Lisa's political convictions are generally liberal and she often contests other's views. She is a
    vegetarian, feminist, environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights and the Free Tibet movement.[21][22] In a
    special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism, even speaking the
    Cornish language to get her message across.[23] While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church in
    which she was raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode "She of Little Faith" (season 13, 2001) after
    she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path.[24] An "End Apartheid Now" poster can be seen on her bedroom door during
    earlier seasons. She is extremely controlled by her ideals and noble, and she undergoes drastic changes when she or
    anyone else is immoral, such as renouncing Homer's last name and taking Marge's when she discovers that Homer bet
    against her in a crossword puzzle competition.

<p class="first">Matt Groening conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James
    L. Brooks's
    office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show and had intended
    to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require
    him to rescind publication rights, Groening went in another direction,[25] hurriedly sketching his version of a
    dysfunctional family, named after members of his own family. Lisa was named after Groening's younger sister, but
    little else was based on her.[26] In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa displayed little of the intelligence for
    which she later became known. She was more of a "female Bart"[27] and was originally described as simply the "middle
    child", without much personality.[28]

    Lisa made her debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good
    Night".[29] In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series on the Fox Broadcasting
    Company.[25]</p>
